learned how to build a simple blog post type api with all the useful methods (GET,POST,DELETE,PATCH).

used Node.js as my backend language, express.js is going to help create routes easier and middlewares and used mongodb together with mongoose to create schemas and models that define how the data looks.

used MongoDB Atlas and Postman
